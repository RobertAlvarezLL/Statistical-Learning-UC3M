# Statistical-Learning-UC3M

## Project Description
This project undertakes the challenge of applying statistical learning and machine learning tools to analyze and predict outcomes on two real datasets. The first dataset focuses on heart disease classification, while the second dataset it is about Wine Quality classification .

## Objectives
- **Part 1**: Identify the main predictors affecting the outcome using the complete dataset and statistical learning tools.
- **Part 2**: Predict the outcome using different training/testing sets through machine learning tools.

## Dataset
- **Project 1**: [Heart Disease Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bharath011/heart-disease-classification-dataset)
- **Project 2**: [Wine Quality Classification Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)

## Methodology
### Part 1: Statistical Tools
- Data preparation and exploration.
- Classification modeling using statistical tools, with an emphasis on probabilities.

### Part 2: Machine Learning Tools
- Data preparation and exploration.
- Classification modeling using machine learning tools, with an emphasis on performance.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- R 
- Specific libraries for statistical analysis and machine learning.

## Results
Key findings are detailed in both projects including a cost sensitive approach.
